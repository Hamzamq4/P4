Branch: 2nd-Iteration-

#Executable
There is an APK file included in the files ("SpyRun.apk"). This can be open on an Android device (Preferably a phone). However, in order to run the game on an iOS device, you have to switch build platforms.  Additionally we recommend to watch the following video on how to run the game on iOS (this is the same video we used to build to iOS): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hr4-XNCf8Y&feature=youtu.be

# Gameplay:
Upon launching the game, the user enters the main menu. The User can opt to go straight into a run, go to fremskridt (placeholder panel) or settings (Placeholder panel). When entering a run, the user is first met with an instruction by the agent. The concept of the game is similar to other endless runners. The users have to dodge "physical" obstacles and will also encounter sound obstacles (the user will be warned by the instructor).


# Current Issues
There is currently a bug, which results in instant death of the player character upon pressing "Prøv igen" when caught.
